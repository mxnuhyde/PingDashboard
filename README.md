# IP Monitoring Script with Telegram Notifications

This script monitors the status of a specified IP address and sends real-time notifications to a **Telegram** chat whenever the IP goes online or offline. It also sends periodic hourly updates.

## üöÄ Features

- **Ping Monitoring**: The script pings the given IP address at regular intervals (default: every 60 seconds).
- **Telegram Integration**: Sends notifications to a Telegram chat when the IP is online or offline.
- **Hourly Updates**: Provides a status update at the start of each new hour.
- **Command Handling**: You can query the current status of the IP by sending a `/stato` command via Telegram.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask**: Web framework to handle Telegram commands.
- **ping3**: Python library to ping an IP address.
- **requests**: For sending HTTP requests to the Telegram API.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install flask ping3 requests
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Before running the script, modify the following variables in the code:

IP_ADDRESS The IP address you want to monitor.
CHECK_INTERVAL The number of seconds between each ping check (default is 60 seconds).
TELEGRAM_TOKEN The token for your Telegram bot.
CHAT_ID The Telegram chat ID where the notifications will be sent.
BOT_PORT The port on which the bot will receive commands (default is 5000).


## üìú How it works
**Initial Status**: On startup, the script checks the initial status of the specified IP address and sends a message to Telegram indicating whether it is online or offline.
**Real-time Monitoring**: The script pings the IP at regular intervals and sends a message to the Telegram chat whenever the status changes (IP goes online or offline).
**Hourly Updates**: Every hour, the script sends a status update indicating whether the IP is online or offline.
**Telegram Commands**: The bot listens for the /stato command and replies with the current status of the IP.


## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Script
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ip-monitor-telegram.git
cd ip-monitor-telegram
```

Run the script:
```bash
python ip_monitor.py
```
Ensure that Flask and the other dependencies are installed.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
Make sure your **Telegram bot** is created and the **bot token** is correctly set.
The script runs indefinitely and will keep monitoring the IP address. You can stop it manually by pressing Ctrl + C.
This script requires an active internet connection to send notifications via Telegram.
